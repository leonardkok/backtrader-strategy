# Trading Strategy Backtesting: MACD vs. MACD+RSI on TESLA

Objective: This notebook implements and evaluates two algorithmic trading strategies based on common technical indicators, using historical data for TESLA (TSLA) stock. The primary goal is to quantitatively compare the performance of a strategy solely relying on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator against a refined strategy that incorporates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as an additional filter.
